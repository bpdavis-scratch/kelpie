Kelpie is an SIP to XMPP gateway

It attempts to make sip endpoints appear as xmpp endpoints and vice-versa

The gateway only focuses on protocol translation, a SIP proxy (such as Kamailio) 
and a federated xmpp server are required for routing.


XMPP->SIP

This is the easiest case, the xmpp client adds user@{kelpie.hostname} to his contact 
list, this gets translated as user@{outbound.siproxy} and the proxy routes the messages

SIP->XMPP

This direction is more complicated.
The sip proxy should identify that user is actually an xmpp endpoint and forwards to 
the kelpie gateway.  Kelpie has a mapping of "user" to xmpp ids in its properties file,  
if it is found it forwards the message to the specified xmpp server. If the contact is
not mapped, Kelpie will attempt to lookup its fullJID and send an invite/request.


example:
com.voxbone.kelpie.mapping.user=user@jabber.org
would map sent to sip:user@{kelpie.hostname} to user@jabber.org


if you don't want to use the mapping file, the format
sip:user+xmpp-server@{kelpie.hostname} can also be used instead
